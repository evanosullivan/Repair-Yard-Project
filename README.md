# Repair-Yard-Project
Simulation of a repair yard with lists of parts and vehicles. Some number of random vehicle types with some broken and some working parts arrive each day. Working parts are salvaged and added to the inventory. Vehicles are repaired using parts from salvage vehicles or are ordered. Simulation progresses on a day-by-day basis controlled by the user. Daily reports and inventories are printed to the console.
