# Repair-Yard-Project
Simulation of a repair yard with lists of parts and vehicles. Random vehicle types with some broken and some working parts. Working parts are salvaged and added to the inventory. Vehicles are repaired using parts from salvage vehicles or are ordered. Simulation progresses on a day-by-day basis controlled by the user. Daily reports and inventories are printed to the console.
